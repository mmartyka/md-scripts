Tutorial for the utilities in mdtools/

------------------------------------------------------------------------


0.    Introduction.

      This tutorial is intended as a guide to running a typical surface
      hopping dynamics calculation. The Tully surface hopping algorithm
      is inherently statistical, so multiple trajectories have to be 
      calculated and averaged. This process is divided into three
      parts:

       1. Sampling ground state geometries.
       2. Preparing the surface hopping trajectory input files.
       3. Running and analysing the surface hopping jobs.

      This tutorial explains how to use the scripts (most of them written
      in Python) located in the mdtools/ folder to perform these tasks.
      It is not intended to cover all the options available for each
      script. Full documentation of the options can be found by running
      the script in question with the --help option.

      The tutorial refers to an example run for the dynamics of
      the methaniminium ion. Input files and typical outputs for this
      run can be found in the example/ directory.

      The tutorial assumes that the command 'mndo-md' points to an MNDO
      executable with the excited state dynamics module enabled. All
      dynamics calculations that can be performed with MNDO as a
      standalone program use the NVE ensemble. In combination with
      ChemShell an NVT ensemble can be utilised for the initial ground
      state dynamics. Currently there is no option to generate a Wigner
      distribution of the initial velocities. Details of the MNDO dynamics
      implementation and further examples of its use can be found in Ref. 1.

      All Python scripts have been developed and tested using Python
      version 2.5. More recent versions (2.7.x) should also be suitable.



1.    Sampling ground state geometries.

      The first task is to generate a realistic sample of ground 
      state geometries, from which the starting geometries for the
      surface hopping runs can be selected.

1.1.  Sampling from a Born-Oppenheimer dynamics run.

      One way of obtaining a realistic sample is to take snapshots
      from a ground state (Born-Oppenheimer) molecular dynamics run.

      We first generate the starting geometry from an ordinary 
      OM2/GUGA-CI ground state optimisation. 

      Example: example/1_sampling/md/optimisation/

      In the regular MNDO input file (named mndo.inp throughout this
      tutorial) we use the same active space here that we intend to use
      for the excited state dynamics later:
       - movo=1, to explicitly specify the active orbitals (3 5 6 7)
         (these orbitals were determined from inspection of the 
         Molden output of a previous OM2-only calculation).
       - ici1=3 ici2=1, to specify 3 occupied and 1 unoccupied active
         orbital.
       - nciref=3 mciref=0, to automatically select 3 reference 
         configurations corresponding to the ground state, a single 
         excitation from the HOMO into the LUMO, and a double
         excitation from the HOMO into the LUMO.
       - levexc=2, for single and double excitations from the reference
         configurations. (This would be a typical setting for a larger 
         active space, but here we are already effectively doing
         a complete active space calculation).
       - imomap=1, to ensure that the active space is correctly 
         mapped during the optimisation.  

      Run the optimisation with:
         mndo-md < mndo.inp > mndo.out

      The output should look like mndo.out.chk.

      The optimised geometry is now used to set up the dynamics 
      calculation.

      Example: example/1_sampling/md/dynamics/

      The mndo.inp file needed now is similar to the optimisation input,
      with the following major changes:
       - the initial geometry is now the optimised geometry
       - jop=-2 icross=6 is used to specify dynamics
       - ncigrd=1 is added requesting an extra line of input at the end
         to specify that the gradient of state 1 should be calculated.

      An extra input file, dynvar.in, is needed by MNDO to specify
      dynamics options. In particular:
       - INIT_STAT=1, EHRENFEST=F, TULLY_HOP=F, specifies ground state
         Born-Oppenheimer dynamics.
       - NSTEP=4000, DT=0.5E-3, specifies a 20ps run.
       - TEMP0=298, is used to set the (random) initial velocities
         based on an instantaneous temperature of 298K. Note that the 
         'temperature' will vary considerably over the course of the
         run - this setting is only used to give a reasonable set 
         of initial velocities.
       - RND_GEN=PM_BD, RND_SEED=11111, seeds one of the portable
         random number generators. A value for RND_SEED is specified
         here to make the results reproducible (up to the limit of
         numerical precision, choice of compiler, etc.) When doing so
         care must be taken that different seeds are used for
         independent calculations within the same project to avoid
         identical random number sequences.

      Run the calculation as before. In addition to the normal output,
      there should be a file traj.out, which contains the dynamics 
      trajectory in Molden format. Compare this with traj.out.chk 
      (which contains only the first two and last two geometries, as 
      the full file is rather large).

      A sample of snapshots can now be taken.

      Script: mdsample.py

      The mdsample script reads in a trajectory file in Molden or
      XYZ format (the relevant section of the Molden file is the
      [GEOMETRIES] section which must have XYZ format; ZMAT format
      is not supported) and outputs either a random sample of
      snapshots or snapshots taken at fixed intervals. In this
      case we will take a random sample of 100 snapshots.

      Run the script with: 
         mdsample.py --vel --sample-size=100 --random-seed=12345

      (Again, a random seed has been specified only to make the results
      reproducible.)

      Output files are sample.xyz (with the geometries in XYZ format)
      and sample.vel (containing the corresponding velocities), from
      now on referred to as the sample files. The output should look
      like sample.*.chk.

1.2.  Using a thermostat with ChemShell.

      An alternative to a pure Born-Oppenheimer dynamics run is the
      combination with a thermostat in order to produce a canonical
      (NVT) ensemble of configurations. The advantage of a constant
      temperature is a more realistic sampling of the ground state
      potential energy surface as the temperature may fluctuate quite
      strongly for a microcanonical (NVE) ensemble.

      For this purpose ChemShell may be used. An example input file
      can be found under: example/1_sampling/md/chemshell/
      It uses a Nosé-Hoover chain of length 10.

      The resulting dynamics.trj file can then be converted to traj.out
      and vel.out files using the script Chemsh_getSample.sh. (Although
      this script accepts an alternative trajectory file name as its
      argument, the default will be dynamics.trj if no argument is
      specified. The names of the written files are fixed.)

      The following steps (generation of snapshots using mdsample.py
      etc.) are the same as in section 1.1.


2.    Preparing the surface hopping input files.

      Example: example/2_hopping/

      Each surface hopping job requires a regular MNDO input file with
      an individual starting geometry as well as common theory options,
      and a dynamics input file (dynvar.in) specifying the correct
      initial state as well as common dynamics options. Depending on
      the restart option in dynvar.in, a third input file (dynam.restart
      by default) containing the initial velocities is also needed.
      This is the case in the example in this tutorial.

      The geometries and velocities are extracted from the sample files
      (the output from section 1.1) and converted to the required MNDO
      input files using the script mdfilter.py. By default, for each
      trajectory the script creates a separate folder named run0001,
      run0002, run0003 etc. in which all individual input and output
      files will be stored. The name of the script indicates that
      usually not all structures in the sample will be used to start
      a trajectory, but the geometries will be subject to further
      automated filtering (see section 2.3).

      While the contents of the mandatory input files mndo.inp and
      dynvar.in is controlled by the user via appropriate template
      files (template.inp and dynvar.in, same name), generation of
      the restart files is completely automated and this file type
      can be treated as a black box. A detailed description of the
      information to be included in the template files and how to
      apply the mdfilter.py script will be provided in the following
      sections.

2.1.  The template dynamics options file.

      Example: example/2_hopping/dynvar.in

      The dynamics template file is an ordinary MNDO dynamics input,
      except that INIT_STAT is omitted (the initial electronic state
      is determined later as it may vary from job to job if transitions
      from the ground state into one of several excited states are
      allowed at the beginning of each surface hopping trajectory;
      in this tutorial only the second excited state is considered).
      NB: If INIT_STAT is present, it will be ignored.

      The main differences from the ground state dynamics options are:
       - EHRENFEST=F, TULLY_HOP=T, specifies the surface hopping 
         algorithm of Tully [2, 3].
       - NSTEP=4000, DT=5.0E-5, specifies a 200fs run with 0.05fs time
         steps. Such a small time step (compared with a purely classical
         MD) may be considered a safe starting point to avoid problems
         with orbital tracking and state following, and because transitions
         to the ground state are likely to occur well within 200fs for our
         system. Especially when using the adaptive algorithm [5] the
         time step might be increased after some testing.
       - NUM_CC=F, AN_CC=T. Analytic non-adiabatic couplings will 
         be calculated. For larger systems, the computational cost can 
         be reduced by using numerical non-adiabatic couplings. 
       - EINTEG=UP3, NE=200. The default options for integrating the 
         Tully electronic equation.
       - No RND_SEED. In this case we do not specify a seed as each
         job should have its own seed. This means that the individual 
         jobs will not be reproducible, although the average over all 
         jobs should give similar results.
       - ADAPT_ENE=0.0001, ADAPT_MAP=97, ADAPT_TRIES=10. [5]
         The adaptive time step algorithm is used that will reject a
         calculation step and reduce the time step in the next try if:
            - The relative total energy exceeds the amount specified
              by option ADAPT_ENE, or
            - One of the active MO mapping overlap factors is below
              the threshold given by option ADAPT_MAP.
         In this example the maximum relative total energy change is set 
         to 0.0001 (which means no bigger change than 0.01%) and the
         overlap of all corresponding MOs in two consecutive steps must
         be at least 0.97. Alternatively, a maximum absolute total
         energy change (of 0.05 kcal/mol in this case) may be specified
         by ADAPT_ENE_MODE=1 and ADAPT_ENE=0.05. At most 10 iterative
         step reductions are done (option ADAPT_TRIES).

2.2.  The template MNDO input file.

      Example: example/2_hopping/template.inp

      The template MNDO input file has the same format as an ordinary
      MNDO input, but not all options that appear in the final input
      need to be included. Only theory options have to be specified,
      such as charge, multiplicity, the choice of Hamiltonian and
      GUGA-CI options (including, importantly, the choice of orbitals
      for the active space). A reference geometry should also be
      included, which normally would be a ground state optimised
      geometry (i.e. the same that was used to start Born-Oppenheimer
      dynamics in section 1.1). The active orbital list must
      correspond to orbitals calculated at the given geometry.

      Options that specify the type of job (jop, icross, etc.) or the 
      gradients to be used in the dynamics (specified by ncigrd)
      SHOULD NOT be set in the template file. They will be inserted
      automatically later.

      Print options (nprint, ioutci, iuvcd, etc.) may also be set if 
      desired to control the level of output in the dynamics runs. 
      In the example, mprint=-1 and nprint=-5 are set to minimise
      the MNDO output during dynamics.

      The template input file should use keywords and be in free format
      (iform=1) and the geometry should be specified using Cartesians
      (igeom=1).

2.3.  An overview of sample geometry filtering.

      Script: mdfilter.py

      The mdfilter script takes the sample files as input and accepts
      or rejects individual sample geometries based on tests using
      the molecule in template.inp (see section 2.2) as reference.
      (If a structure is accepted, it will be the starting point for
      one or more trajectories depending on the allowed number of
      excited states. In this tutorial only one excited state, S2,
      is considered.)

      The sample geometries can be filtered according to various
      criteria:

       1. Active space mapping: a geometry is selected only if the
          active orbitals can be successfully mapped from the template
          molecule to the new geometry. This ensures that the active 
          orbitals are correctly defined at the start of every 
          surface hopping run.
       2. Energy window: a geometry is only selected if the excitation 
          energy for a state is within a certain tolerance of a target 
          excitation energy (usually defined as the excitation energy 
          for the template molecule).
       3. Transition probability: the probability for excitation to a 
          target state k can be calculated as [4]

                Pk = (fk/(Ek-E0)^2) / max(fk/(Ek-E0)^2)

          where fk is the oscillator strength of the transition to 
          state k, Ek and E0 are the energies of states k and 0, and 
          the probability is normalised by taking the maximum computed 
          ratio over all geometries and selected states k.
          A stochastic algorithm is used to determine whether the 
          excitation is selected according to the probability Pk.

      By default all three filters are applied, but it is not normally
      necessary to use both criterion 2 and criterion 3. In this
      tutorial, criterion 2 will be skipped.

      In addition to the above, the output geometries are by default 
      restricted to a single target state. Alternatively, excitations
      to all calculated states can be considered (using the option -a
      or --all-states). Each selected state has its own dynamics run, 
      so a given sample geometry may be used for more than one run.

      The filtering procedure is carried out simultaneously with the 
      preparation of the surface hopping input files, as described in 
      section 2.4.

2.4.  Preparing the surface hopping jobs.

      Script: mdfilter.py

      The mdfilter script is used for preparing the surface hopping
      input files, by passing the -d (or --dynamics) option. By
      default, each dynamics run is set up in its own directory, with
      the name 'run' followed by the number of the run.

      To run the script, first copy your sample files (sample.xyz and
      sample.vel) into the 2_hopping/ directory. Then run:
         mdfilter.py --vel --target-state=3 --mapthr=0.7 -W -d
                     --random-seed=9999

      The options are:
       --vel               Read the sample velocity file (default name:
                           sample.vel), extract initial velocities and
                           create a corresponding restart file
                           (run00xy/dynam.restart) for each dynamics run.
       --target-state=3    Only excitations to the S2 state (state 3 in
                           the GUGA-CI module of MNDO) will be considered.
       --mapthr=0.7        The threshold for active space mapping is by
                           default 90%, for both filtering and dynamics.
                           For filtering, where the sample and reference
                           geometries are fixed (the adaptive time step
                           algorithm can be applied only during dynamics),
                           the threshold is reduced to 70% because too many
                           sample structures would be rejected otherwise.
                           During surface hopping the options specified
                           in the dynvar.in template file (see section
                           2.1) take precedence, so in this case the
                           adaptive algorithm with a MO mapping threshold
                           of 97% is used.
       -W                  Switch off energy window filtering (criterion
                           2 in section 2.3).
       -d                  Prepare dynamics input files.
       --random-seed=9999  Again, only to ensure reproducibility of the 
                           filtering (the actual jobs will not be
                           reproducible, as discussed in section 2.1).

      Because we have restricted excitations to state 3 where the
      transition probability is always above 90%, only five geometries
      are filtered out, and 95 pass the filter.

      The filtering is summarised in filtered-info.log and a list of
      selected geometries in XYZ format is written to
      filtered-sample.xyz. The output should be the same as in the
      respective .chk files. For each of the 95 selected geometries,
      a directory 'run00xy' is created containing the appropriate
      dynamics input files.



3.    Running and analysing the surface hopping jobs.

3.1.  Running the surface hopping jobs.

      Surface hopping jobs are executed like any other MNDO job. Set
      the current directory to the folder of each job and run:
         mndo-md < mndo.inp > mndo.out

      Instead of starting all calculations manually, a queuing system
      may be used. An example submit script named QSUB_MD for the
      queuing system "Sun Grid Engine" can be found in the mdtools
      folder. Please note that the path to the MNDO executable has to be
      adjusted at mndo_path=... To submit all trajectories at once use
      the example call:
      qsub -t {min}-{max} -tc {maxRunning} QSUB_MD
      The -t flag determines the range of trajectories (e.g. -t 1-150
      starts the calculations in the folders run0001 to run0150).
      The -tc flag determines the maximum number of calculations run
      at the same time.

      It is quite common for a job to fail during the dynamics 
      calculations because of the highly distorted geometries that can 
      be reached. This can be due to SCF convergence failure, orbital 
      tracking failure, state following failure, etc. If the job fails 
      it is advisable to re-run it, as a new random seed will be used 
      (unless the user has selected a specific value) and hence a new
      trajectory will be calculated.

3.2.  Analysing the surface hopping jobs.

3.2.1 Extracting MD and hopping data.

      The results of surface hopping calculations are stored in the
      hopping.out file. Some other data (e.g. numerical nonadiabatic
      couplings) are printed to standard output if IOUT .GE. 2 (we
      suppose in the following that the standard output was redirected
      to a file named mndo.out). General information about dynamics is
      stored in the file stat.out.

      The files hopping.out and mndo.out are not suitable for plotting
      and to manipulate the data. Therefore the data must be extracted.
      Data stored in the stat.out file do not need to be extracted
      since this file is already suitable for plotting and manipulation.

      To extract information from the files hopping.out and mndo.out
      the script MDextr.py can be used. In a directory containing the
      regular MNDO input file (mndo.inp), the dynamics input file
      (dynvar.in) and the output files (hopping.out and mndo.out) run:

         MDextr.py

      For each trajectory several files will be stored in the directory
      MD_data that will be created inside the folder of the
      corresponding trajectory containing the following data at each
      time interval:

         E1.dat             Energy of the first state (ground state)
         E2.dat             Energy of the second state
       * E3.dat             Energy of the third state
         E12.dat            Energy difference E2-E1
       * E13.dat            Energy difference E3-E1
       * E23.dat            Energy difference E3-E2
         CC12.dat           Nonadiabatic coupling between states 1 and 2
       * CC13.dat           Nonadiabatic coupling between states 1 and 3
       * CC23.dat           Nonadiabatic coupling between states 2 and 3
         pop1.dat           Electronic population of state 1
         pop2.dat           Electronic population of state 2
       * pop3.dat           Electronic population of state 3
         prob1.dat          Probability of hopping to state 1
         prob2.dat          Probability of hopping to state 2
       * prob3.dat          Probability of hopping to state 3
         rnd_num.dat        Random number for hopping criterion
         state.dat          State on which dynamics is performed
      $  num_CC12           Numerical coupling between states 1 and 2
      $* num_CC13           Numerical coupling between states 1 and 2
      $* num_CC23           Numerical coupling between states 2 and 3

      Files denoted with * are created only if (at least) three states
      are included in the simulation. Files denoted by $ are created
      only if the file mndo.out is present and no option -n or --nonumCC
      has been used.

      In the example, the files marked * will be created, but the files
      marked $ will not, because numerical nonadiabatic couplings are
      not calculated during the dynamics runs.

      As the number of trajectories is usually rather large, invocation
      of MDextr.py for each subdirectory run00xy has been automated using
      the script trajectories_data_generator.sh which needs to be started
      without arguments from the folder that contains these subdirectories.
      (Note that the script currently can handle at most 1000 trajectories,
      but this limit can be increased very easily if needed by editing
      the script. Also note that there will be no warning or error message
      if there are more than 1000 trajectories. The script will simply
      process the first 1000 subdirectories and ignore the rest.)

3.2.2 Averaging.

      Surface hopping simulations are stochastic simulations. Therefore
      the data from many trajectories must be averaged to obtain meaningful
      results.

      First the unfinished trajectory folders need to be sorted out. 
      This can be done with the two scripts 
      trajectories_check_I_length.tcsh and
      trajectories_check_II_energy_crash.tcsh
      When executed in the calculation main folder, it will rename the 
      folders of unfinished or incorrect trajectories to run****_bk.
      (Note that these scripts currently can handle at most 1000
      trajectories, but this limit can be increased very easily if
      needed by editing the scripts. Also note that there will be no
      warning or error message if there are more than 1000 trajectories.
      The scripts will simply process the first 1000 subdirectories and
      ignore the rest.)

      The average over data stored in files created by the MDextr.py
      script (see section 3.2.1) can be performed by the script 
      mmean.py.

      Before running the script a list file must be prepared containing
      a list of all the files to include in the averaging process.
      Suppose that different trajectories are stored in directories
      run0001, run0002, run0003, ..., run000N and that each directory
      contains a directory MD_data. Then to get the average of the
      energy of the first state for instance the list file will be:

         run0001/MD_data/E1.dat
         run0002/MD_data/E1.dat
         run0003/MD_data/E1.dat
               .
               .
               .
         run000N/MD_data/E1.dat

      Assuming you want to average over all trajectories, this list can
      be easily generated by:

          ls run*/MD_data/E1.dat > data.ls

      Once the list file is ready, run:

          mmean.py

      The file data.mean will be created.

      In order to determine the average occupation of each state during
      the course of the dynamics, averaging cannot be done in the same
      way as above as this would result in a single curve of fractional
      state numbers. Instead, one curve for each state representing the
      fraction of trajectories propagating on the potential energy
      surface of this state at each time interval needs to be
      calculated. This is done by calling the mmean.py script using
      option -s or --state. The data.ls file needs to point to the
      state.dat files (instead of E1.dat above).

      Example: 2_hopping/state.mean.chk

      For the methaniminium example run:

          mmean.py -s --out-file state.mean

      The output should be similar to state.mean.chk (and also to figure
      5 of Ref. 1, although the results are not directly comparable as
      some different options have been used in this tutorial). This file
      contains the data for all states (the three lowest states in our
      example) in a consecutive manner.

      The lifetime of the S2 state can be fit to the exponential
      function n(S2) = exp(-t/T(S2)). This gives a lifetime of 15.0 fs.
      The lifetime of the S1 state can then be fit using:

      n(S1) = [T(S1)/(T(S2)-T(S1))] . [exp(-t/T(S2))-exp(-t/T(S1))]

      For state.mean.chk, this gives an S1 lifetime of 82.6 fs. Again,
      your results should be similar but not necessarily the same as the
      lifetimes will not be fully converged using just 95 trajectories.

      A script is provided called trajectories_state_average.tcsh, which
      does the generation of data.ls and the subsequent calling of 
      mmean.py for average state occupations automatically. (Note that
      the script currently can handle at most 1000 trajectories, but
      this limit can be increased very easily if needed by editing the
      script. Also note that there will be no warning or error message
      if there are more than 1000 trajectories. The script will simply
      process the first 1000 subdirectories and ignore the rest.)

3.2.3 Analyzing trajectories.

      The geometries in a trajectory file can be analyzed using the
      program geoman.py.

      Usage:
           geoman.py [options] file

      By default the XYZ geometries from the trajectory file will be
      printed out. The output can be restricted to a specific range
      of geometries using the option:

           geoman.py --range=R1 R2 file

      Alternatively, geometrical parameters such as bond lengths and
      bond angles can be calculated by specifying the relevant atom
      numbers. For example:

           geoman.py --angle=A1 A2 A3 file

      This will print out the bond angle A1-A2-A3 for each geometry.
      The other available parameters are --length, --dihedral, and
      --outofplane.

      For a full list of options, see:

           geoman.py --help

      Files created by geoman.py can be subsequently averaged by
      mmean.py (see section 3.2.2)
